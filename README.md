# studentsubmit

This project is a PHP based submission system for student work. Students upload their files, and the system issues a receipt.  The system is not databased backed, but stores the submissions in a configuable directory structure.  The original purpose of the directory structure was to allow me to run a compilation and testing script against the submissions.
